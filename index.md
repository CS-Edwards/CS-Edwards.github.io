### Data is a Drag: Exploring Classical Machine Learning Algorithms on Small and Imbalanced Datasets
2023:[view paper](https://github.com/CS-Edwards/ml_final/blob/main/C.Edwards_ICS635_Final_Report.pdf)<br>
The paper explores the performance of classical machine learning algorithms on small and imbalanced datasets by predicting the winner of the TV series RuPaulâ€™s Drag Race using binary classification. Algorithms include: Logistic Regression, Naive-Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forest . The paper discusses and demonstrates hyperparameter tuning techniques and various cross validation approaches to identify the most performative classifier for the dataset.


### Building a Custom Vector Search Engine with Weaviate
2022: [view notebook](https://github.com/CS-Edwards/vse/blob/main/Weaviate_Project.ipynb)<br>
The project discusses the architecture of Weaviate, an open-source vector database and provides a tutorial implementation of a custom vector search engine using Weaviate Cloud Service (WCS). The project explores the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) graph-based index for vector similarity search, dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP) for visualization, and various other features of Weaviate.

### Exceptional Trees of Oahu Visualization
2022: [view repo](https://github.com/CS-Edwards/oahu_trees) <br>
Data visualization of the taxonomic relationships of the trees on Oahu, Hawaii. The tree data is sourced from Exceptional Trees on Oahu API, and Wikipedia. 

### Egocentralities and the Ethereum Network:
2022: [view paper](https://bit.ly/3PEtHVn)<br>
This paper discusses and applies node-based centrality metrics to perform network analysis on a sample of the Ethereum Network. Centrality metrics, such as degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, Katz centrality and PageRank are used to identify influential contract addresses in the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Raspberry Pi Parallel Computing:

Independent RPi cluster-build and distributed computing project

### Qinfolk Project:
2019: [view project](https://bit.ly/3wUp01k)<br>
QTPOC film, art and mental health project based in Ithaca, NY
